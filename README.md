# MongoDB
 MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NOSQL database.
 MongoDB is written in C++. This tutorial will give you great understanding on MONGODB concepts needed to create and deploy a highly scalable and performance-oriented database.

 ## NOSQL DB
 Data Store in JSON format like (BSON).
 Horizontal Scalable
 Key Value Pair : 
 ```bash
 {
     name : "prakash",
     age : 20,
     degree : "BCA"
 }
 ```

 # Mongo, MongoD, Mongo Compass, Mongo Atlas..
 ## Mongo
 It is the Command-line shell that connects to a specific instance of MongoD.

 ## MongoD
 It is the Mongo Daemon, basically the host process for the database, run it in the background.

## Mongo Compass
It is a powerful GUI for querying, aggregating and analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual enviroment.

## Mongo Atlas
It is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing and healing your deployments on the cloud server provider of your choice (AWS, AZURE).


## JSON (JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION)
It's a light weight format for storing and transporting data, JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to web page. 

It is a common mistake to call a JSON object literal "a JSON object".

JSON cannot be an object. JSON is a string format.

The data is only JSON when it is in a string format. When it is converted to a JavaScript variable, it becomes a JavaScript object.

```bash
{
   "Course": [
      {
         "id":"033",
         "language": "JavaScript"
      },	
      {
         "id":"034",
         "language": "MongoDB"
      }
   ]
}
```
